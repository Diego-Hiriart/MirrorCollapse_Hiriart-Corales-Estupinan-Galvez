  description: "This is definitely not a dream, it definitely looks like one, but
    it doesn\u2019t feel like it. What\u2019s with the sun in here anyway? It\u2019s
    red and not that bright. I really hope I\u2019m dreaming because I hate this.
    I\u2019ll keep looking around to check if there\u2019s another one of those broken
    mirrors that brought me here."
