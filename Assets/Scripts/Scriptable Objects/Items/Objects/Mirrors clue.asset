  description: "I don\u2019t even know how I got here, but judging by the stuff laying
    around, others have been here before. I read on someone\u2019s diary that apparently
    mirrors here either store your reflection or transport you between worlds. This
    place seems fine, there\u2019s something outside though, and I can\u2019t shake
    off the sensation that this feels like a dream."
