  description: "While that big monster chased me around it said something about this
    reflection not being the one. I\u2019m not sure what it meant by that, but I
    sure hope this is the real world. Still, I must admit I have the feeling that
    the monster is right, I feel so weird here\u2026 Anyways, I gotta the hell out
    of here through that broken mirror."
