  description: "Two mirrors? This has never happened before; I killed that disgusting
    thing and now I must choose which mirror I should get into? All I know is that
    the world I got into using the broken mirror was awful, but I didn\u2019t feel
    as weird as I do in the \u201Cnormal one\u201D, it felt unreal. I can\u2019t
    take any more of this, please let this be the last mirror I have to cross"
