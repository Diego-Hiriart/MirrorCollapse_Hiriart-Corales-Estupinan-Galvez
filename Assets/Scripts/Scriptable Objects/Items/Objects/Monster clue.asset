  description: "Dammit! One of those things has the next key but I don\u2019t have
    any more ammo. I\u2019ll have to search this house and see if I can find more.
    Last time I saw the monster; it was hanging around the back of the house. I hope
    it stays there cuz the forest is full of those things."
