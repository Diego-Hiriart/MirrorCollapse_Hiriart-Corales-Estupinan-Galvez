  description: "I have to go out there again and get the key that I dropped near
    one of the corners of that metal fence. If I\u2019m not wrong, it should open
    of the rooms that has a brand-new mirror. I can only hope that mirror takes me
    back to that nice place again\u2026 if the ghosts kill me and someone finds this,
    GET THE KEY AND GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE!"
